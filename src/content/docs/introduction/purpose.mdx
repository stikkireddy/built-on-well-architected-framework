# Overview

Organizations today are increasingly looking to deliver data- and AI-powered experiences to their customers—whether through embedded analytics, prediction-driven workflows, AI assistants, or shared data products. Databricks enables partners to extend these capabilities outward, transforming internal data and AI assets into customer-facing features, services, and revenue-generating products.

This Well-Architected Framework defines what it means to build a solution "Built On Databricks" and provides clear architectural guidance for designing, deploying, and operating these intelligent offerings.
